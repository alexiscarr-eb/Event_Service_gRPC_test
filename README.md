# Event_Service_gRPC_test

This is NOT Event Service. This is proto-Event Service playground (see what I did there?). Only very simple endpoints with a scaled down proto will be implemented. Just to get a feel for what developing in gRPC and Kotlin with gradle is like. At most the most it'll have a DynamoDB data persistence layer. No caching. No pub/sub. Just a stand-alone "proto-Event Service" to mess around in.
